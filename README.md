# Secure Your GitHub Account: Remember to Logout

When using GitHub, especially on shared or public devices, it's crucial to ensure the safety of your account by logging out after you're done. This simple step prevents unauthorized access to your account and protects your sensitive data.

## Why Should You Logout?
1. **Account Security**: Logging out ensures no one else can access your account after you've used it on another computer.
2. **Protects Private Repositories**: If unauthorized users gain access, they could view or alter your private repositories.
3. **Prevents Unauthorized Actions**: Remaining signed in on unfamiliar devices could allow others to commit changes, delete repositories, or even compromise your account.

**Never forget to log out! Your security depends on it.**

## Steps to Logout from GitHub
1. **On a Web Browser**:
   - Click on your profile picture in the top-right corner of the GitHub page.
   - From the dropdown menu, select **Sign out**.
   - Confirm that you're logged out by checking the GitHub homepage.

2. **On the GitHub Desktop App**:
   - Click on **File** in the menu bar.
   - Select **Options** (on Windows) or **Preferences** (on Mac).
   - Click **Sign out** under the Accounts section.

3. **Additional Steps for Safety**:
   - Clear browser cookies and cache if you're using a public computer.
   - Avoid saving login credentials on shared devices.
   - Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for an added layer of security.

## Remember: A Simple Logout Goes a Long Way
Your GitHub account contains valuable work and information. Taking a moment to log out is a small but powerful habit that keeps your account safe.

### A Little Reminder in Rhyme
When your coding is done and your work is stout,  
Take a moment to pause and always log out.  
Be it a laptop, a desktop, or a café's screen,  
A logged-out account keeps your data pristine.  

Your GitHub treasures, your projects so fine,  
Deserve your care—don't leave them behind.  
So, heed this reminder, without a doubt:  
For safety and peace, never forget to log out.
```
